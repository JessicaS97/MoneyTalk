# MoneyTalk

This website was built on the basis of solving my struggles to save money as a student. 
With MoneyTalk, the user can set the maximum amount of money they plan to spend, or the budget. As the user keeps adding spendings,
these data will be stored in the computer for unlimited time. They will also have the option to reset all, which could be a useful
option at the start of each month.
As spendings keep increasing, the bar displayed on the main page will keep decreasing until becoming empty, which means they have
spent all the money they had.

## Features

* Time updated every second, to let user know how many days until the month ends
* Dynamic progress bar that updates as the user adds spendings
* Total spendings is calculated and displayed
* Ability to set budget or change it at anytime, and progress bar and total spendings will be updated
* Progress bar changes color depending to how close they are to spending their budget
* Error checking: if user did not set a budget yet, progress bar will not be updated, ask again if they want to delete all data, if user did not input spending they will be told to do so when clicking the add spending button
* Each user will have their own copy of data as it is saved in each ones's computer using localstorage
