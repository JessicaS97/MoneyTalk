# MoneyTalk

This website was built on the basis of solving my struggles to save money as a student. 
With MoneyTalk, the user can set the maximum amount of money they plan to spend, or the budget. As the user keeps adding spendings,
these data will be stored in the computer for unlimited time. They will also have the option to reset all, which could be a useful
option at the start of each month.
As spendings keep increasing, the bar displayed on the main page will keep decreasing until becoming empty, which means they have
spent all the money they had.
